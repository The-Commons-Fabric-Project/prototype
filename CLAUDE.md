# Commons Fabric (TCFP Prototype)

## Summary

A community-events platform prototype ("Commons Fabric" / TCFP): organizations post
events, and a public directory/calendar lets visitors browse them. It's an npm
workspaces monorepo with an Express + Prisma/SQLite backend and a React + Vite +
TanStack Router frontend.

## Development Guidelines

### Comments

Keep comments concise and to a minimum. Exported functions, classes, and non-obvious
constants get a short `/** */` doc comment (usually a few lines explaining *why*,
not what); one-liners or obvious functionality do not need one.  

### Architectural boundaries

- **`frontend/src/api/` is the only place that calls `fetch`.** `client.ts` owns
  request/response handling (prefixing `/v1`, sending the session cookie, converting
  `application/problem+json` into `ApiError`); other modules in that folder wrap one
  endpoint each and hold no state, interpreting no errors themselves. Interpreting a
  failure (e.g. "401 means signed out") belongs to the caller — see `hooks/`.
- **`frontend/src/mocks/` mirrors `frontend/src/api/`** as a mock-backend peer. Flows
  move from `mocks/` to `api/` as they're wired to the real backend; once `mocks/` is
  empty it can be deleted.
- **`backend/src/docs/api/openapi.yaml` is the API contract.** Every request/response
  under `/v1` is validated against it (`middleware/openapi.ts`), so endpoint handlers
  don't need to re-check shapes the schema already guarantees — only rules a JSON
  Schema can't express (e.g. comparing two query params) need explicit checks.
- **`backend/prisma/schema.prisma` is a SQLite-specific translation of
  `backend/src/docs/db/schema.dbml`.** The DBML is the conceptual source of truth
  (enums, Postgres-only constraints); differences are documented at the top of
  `schema.prisma`. Keep both in sync when changing the data model.
- **`backend/src/generated/prisma/` is generated and gitignored.** Never hand-edit it;
  regenerate with `npm run db:generate` after schema changes.
- **Route registration order in `backend/src/app.ts` is load-bearing**: body
  parsing/logging, then routers, then (in production) the static/catch-all handlers,
  then the error handler last. Don't reorder without re-reading the comment there —
  it explains a past bug where the catch-all swallowed real API routes.
- **`packages/` workspaces must not reach outside their own directory.** Each workspace
  declares every dependency it imports and every binary its scripts invoke, rather than
  relying on npm hoisting from the root — see `packages/README.md` for why.

### Commands

- `npm run dev` (root) — runs frontend and backend dev servers concurrently.
- `npm run db:migrate` (backend) — apply/create Prisma migrations against the local
  SQLite dev DB; re-run after pulling new migrations. `npm run db:deploy` applies
  existing migrations only (prod/CI); `npm run db:generate` regenerates the client
  without touching migrations.
- `npm run db:seed` (backend) — loads dev seed data (`prisma/seed/`).
- `npm run storybook` (frontend) — Storybook dev server on a separate port
  (`localhost:6006`); the component docs under `src/docs/*.mdx` live there.
- `npm run generate-routes` (frontend) — regenerates TanStack Router's route tree
  from `src/routes/`; `npm run build` runs this automatically first.

### Workflows

- **Keep the structure section in sync.** When you add, remove, move, or rename a file
  or directory, update the `## Project Structure` tree in the same change, so it never
  drifts from what's actually in the repo.
- **Verify before claiming.** Run the relevant workspace's build/test/lint command
  before reporting work complete, and quote the actual output rather than asserting
  success.
- **Respect the boundaries above.** If a change genuinely needs to cross one (e.g. a
  `fetch` call outside `api/client.ts`, or hand-editing generated Prisma output), say so
  explicitly instead of doing it quietly — these boundaries were drawn on purpose.
- **Treat these guidelines as living.** When corrected on an approach that would recur,
  propose adding it here instead of only fixing the one instance.
