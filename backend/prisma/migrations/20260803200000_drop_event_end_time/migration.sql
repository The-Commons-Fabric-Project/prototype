-- Drops events.ends_at. The UX team decided events carry a start time only.
--
-- This is destructive: the end time of every existing event is discarded, and
-- there is no way back from it without restoring a backup. The column is dropped
-- rather than left nullable because a column nothing reads is a column that
-- silently rots - and schema.dbml, which is the source of truth here, no longer
-- describes one.
--
-- ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN cannot be used even though SQLite supports it:
-- ends_at is named in the `ends_at > starts_at` CHECK, and SQLite refuses to drop
-- a column a constraint depends on. So the table is rebuilt, which is also what
-- lets that CHECK go. Every other column, default, CHECK and foreign key is
-- carried across unchanged - see 20260802194500_email_and_url_checks for where
-- the volunteer_contact and registration_link predicates come from.
